# People Counter

This is a simple JavaScript program that allows you to increment a counter and save previous entries. It consists of an HTML page with a counter, two buttons for incrementing and saving, and a section to display the previous entries.

## Usage

To use the People Counter:

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. You will see the initial count set to 0.
3. Click the "INCREMENT" button to increase the count by 1.
4. Click the "SAVE" button to save the current count and reset it to 0.
5. The saved entries will be displayed under the "Previous entries" section.
